# SHUTUP - Stop python warnings, no matter what!

Sometimes you just can't mute python warnings. Use this library to solve this.

## Installation

```bash
pip install shutup
```

## Using

On the beggining of your code (before you import other things), add this line:

```python
import shutup; shutup.please()
```

That's it. Enjoy the silence :)
